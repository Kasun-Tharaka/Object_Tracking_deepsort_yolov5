what are the cahnges to do when implement a new project:

1. change the yolov5.pt file, it is the detection model of yolo
2. after you have to generate ckpt.t7 file, it is the deepsort model

those are the changes other are remainig same 


in yolov5, run detect_sort file not detect file
both of those are same, but there is some small change in detect_sort file

graph.py is helps to create bounding boxes and generate ids for bboxes

python detect_sort.py --weights yolov5s.pt  --img 640  --source pedestrian.mp4 ---> 
after run this command, it will predict video frame by frame(according to the volov5.pt model- it trained on person- coco dataset has person) and 
regenerating the video in runs folder with tracking


python detect_sort.py --weights yolov5s.pt  --img 640  --source 0  ---> this will track with ur live camera
backend implemented with OpenCV, little bit slow, it capture frams second by second
